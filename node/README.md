# Node.JS BootStrap

A bootstrap that will help you start off your backend on a path for success.  It is setup to have API Documentation, Tests, and a very friendly MVC framework.  These are listed below for documentation reference.

MVC:      [Sails.JS](http://sailsjs.org/) - [Documentation](http://sailsjs.org/#/documentation)

API Docs: [APIDoc](http://apidocjs.com/)

Test:     [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/)

## Setup

Yes, we did bootstrap this as much as possable, but you still have a bit of setup work.  Below you will find the commands to run in order to get this beast up and running.

```
git clone git@github.com:open-austin/OARK-back-end.git
cd OARK-back-end/node
npm install

```

That's it, you're all setup now.  To launch the server just run ```node app.js``` and visit http://127.0.0.1:1337/

API Documentation is available at http://127.0.0.1:1337/api/
